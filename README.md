# Getting Started with WebGL

This project is meant to show a basic example of a WebGL program.

## Prerequisites

To complete this activity you need:

- A text editor
- A web browser that supports WebGL
- A basic understanding of JavaScript

## Introduction

- What is WebGL?
- How does WebGL work?
- What are the benefits of WebGL?
- How can you get started with WebGL?

WebGL is a JavaScript API that allows you to create interactive 3D graphics in a web browser. It's based on OpenGL ES, a graphics library used in many mobile devices, and provides a low-level interface for accessing the graphics hardware on a computer.

There are several benefits to using WebGL for creating 3D graphics on the web:

- Is cross-platform
- Is hardware-accelerated: WebGL uses the graphics hardware to render graphics, which is much faster than using the CPU
- Is easy to use -- at the beginning :P --
